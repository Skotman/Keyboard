# SkeetBoard

This is my big mech keyboard project that I will try to document as much as possible. There is a lot to learn so I will be up against a huge challenge>
but I'm motivated cause it seems really fun to do.

## Idea

The idea for this project is to make a split keyboard. With it's base being a 60% keyboard, where additions can be made to expand it with a numpad and/or the function row.
No space for the Navigation keys besides the arrow. 
Additionally there will be space for 2 OLED screens, as well as the numpad working individually. Potentially there will be some sort of rotary encoder.
As a final point, it will include magnets, so the keyboard will no issue staying together in a non-split situation.

The keyboard will not be ergo based. It will follow the common ANSI-layout. But later on I could look into ISO compatibility. 
Key points for the parts:
- The PCB will be self developed, but based off split keyboards (obviously)
  - Not sure how to do 3 or 4-way splits work, but that's up for my R&D
  - Will have to figure out how to attach OLEDS. Currently I have no knowledge on how to program the chips on a keyboard PCB. So that'll be fun
  - Probably will have to learn Linux syntax at some point
- Case will be metal based, maybe added acrylic. Might be reconsidered. (or even both) 
- Could become focussed on travel and portability
- Hotswappable or multi-compatible with layouts, not sure. Maybe both? seems hard to pull off, especially since no-one has accomplished it thusfar.

## Potential Designs
- Exposed diodes?
- OLEDS for sure
- Split
- Magnetic
- Rotary Encoder compatible
